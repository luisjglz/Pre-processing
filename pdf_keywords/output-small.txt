It describes the current practice that has positively influenced diversity awareness and how HE can use the student voice more effectively to drive forward both institutional change and pro- gramme curricula design to ensure positive outcomes for all students.

making individuals fit into work life and real life. In science education program of Turkey in 2017, these skills were described as analytical thinking, decision-making, creative thinking, entrepreneurship, communication, and teamwork (MoNE, 2017). These skills are also important competencies in STEM education. With STEM education, it is aimed to develop skills for career and business life following the individuals’ school life

Leadership: Leadership skills of individuals are effective in coordinating and sharing tasks among individuals in collaborative group and teamwork (OECD, 2010). Creativity Creativity is defined as the ability to think differently and produce ideas as a results of different thinking (Guilford, 1959). Amabile (1982) refers to creativity as producing
approach that integrates science, technology, engineering and mathematics knowledge and skills (Maryland, 2012). STEM education is aimed at the development of students’ research-questioning, logical reasoning, and working behaviors in a collaboration. In this respect, the aim of STEM education is to train qualified individuals to meet the 21st century workforce needs (Moore, 2009). With the STEM education, it is aimed that
Education 83 Today, many sectors expect individuals to have the skills appropriate for the needs of the age, such as problem solving, creative thinking, high communication skills, being open to collaboration, having responsibility, etc. (Eryılmaz & Uluyol, 2015). 21st century skills helps students to easily adapt to the new situation while they are being taught the new knowledge (Dede, 2010).

need to be able to work in a respectful manner with different teams in the educational environment and business life. With the collaborative education practices, students should be immersed in collaboration. • Creativity and Innovation: The ability to produce a broad idea to create new and useful ideas. Knowledge, Media and Technology Skills: The skills that individuals should have in the

These skills are emerging in the form of Engineering Based Problem Solving Skill, Association Skill, Engineering Based Design Skills, Innovation, Digital Competence, Creativity, and Communication and Collaboration. Engineering Based Problem Solving Skill In STEM education, problem-solving skills are effective in engineering processes that involve planning, designing, constructing, and evaluating for a specific problem (Bagiati Research Highlights in

Communication and Collaboration In STEM education where engineering design-focused work is involved, students interact in a communicative and collaborative way (Crismond & Adams, 2012). Communication and collaboration have emerged as a necessity in K-12 level engineering programs (ABET, 2012). In STEM education, students work together as engineers in a team to present their design projects (Borrego, Karlin,
