Collaborative problem-solving tasks currently under development by PISA offer one of the few examples today of a direct, large-scale assessment targeting social and collaboration competencies; other prototypes are under development by the ATC21S project and by the military. The quality and practical feasibility of any of these measures are not yet fully documented. However,

Thus, formative assessment is conducive to—and may provide direct support for—the de- velopment of transferable cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal skills. A few examples

Because of the closely intertwined nature of cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal competencies an intervention targeting learning and skill development in one domain can influence other domains, as illustrated by a study included in the Durlak et al.

Parenting interventions are a route to boosting the competencies and

Educators may need to consider redesigning and establishing new metrics to measure skills in a broader sense. They could also look to teach soft skills such as problem solving or collaboration in a way that is less subject related, for example through making presentations in class, providing detailed critiques on written assignments, and encouraging deeper thinking that explores questions of why

For instance, within social and emotional skills, we include advanced communication and negotiation, interpersonal skills and empathy, leadership and managing others, entrepreneurship and initiative taking, adaptability and continuous learning, and teaching and training others. We have also separated technological skills from higher cognitive skills, although some of the former require higher cognitive capabilities (see Box 2,

2: Adopting a common skills language Aligning on a common language when talking about skills – within organizations and across stakeholders – through a skills taxonomy can enable more effective collaboration and coordination on skills between learners, learning providers, policy-makers and employers. For employers, a well-balanced skills taxonomy helps people managers broaden their focus from specialist and technical skills to promote
learning pathways to good work – and on the demand side, supporting employers to articulate job descriptions in terms of skills to find suitable candidates. Many countries have adopted public-private collaboration approaches to building sectoral skills maps and taxonomies to capture skill demand in each sector, including the development of corresponding professional standards.28 For example, Georgia recently established a new skills

approaches can be heuristically categorized according to two axes: the underlying philosophy of science, ranging from positivism to constructivism, and the perceived role of the theorist, ranging from analyst to influencer (see Figure 1). The boundaries between the categories are porous because different approaches often overlap each other rather than being neatly separated. Theories in forecasting are connected to a positivistic

For example, forecasts become part of the forecasted social reality, imagined scenarios may expand what is seen as possible, and futurist facilitators in a visioning process may influence the outcome at many points.

It notes that the term ‘competence’ is widely used across Europe but that several countries substitute ‘learning outcomes’ (p. 31). Also that the learning or working ‘context has a strong influence on the range of learning outcomes that are considered important …’ (p. 31). ‘Competence’ tends to be associated with labour force requirements, whereas ‘learning outcomes’ has connotations beyond the job
Learner agency tends to involve some or all of these elements: • the choice of meaningful, authentic activities • selecting relevant, interest-led activities • self-initiated learning, with appropriate guidance • influence over what and how is learned • an active voice in the process. 22 See https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evidence-summaries/teaching-learning- toolkit/individualised-instruction/ 23 https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/vak-learning-styles.htm 24 https://core-ed.org/research-and-innovation/ten-trends/2014/learner-agency/ 34 Co-agency, a more recent term, points to the
way: ‘To help enable agency, educators must not only recognise learners’ individuality, but also acknowledge the wider set of relationships – with their teachers, peers, families and communities – that influence their learning. A concept underlying the learning framework is “co-agency” – the interactive, mutually supportive relationships that help learners to progress towards their valued goals. In this context, everyone should

In a school context Furguson and colleagues share evidence about the influence of teachers in developing ‘noncognitive factors’ or meta-skills, (Ferguson et al., 2015).

Introduction In the knowledge society, organizations operate in a global economy characterized by intense competition together with eco- nomic interdependence and collaboration. By globalizing the pro- duction of goods and services, thousands of jobs, particularly in manufacturing, have been eliminated by automation or relocation to industrialized countries (Anderson, 2008; Levy & Murnane,
& Smith, 2013). Knowledge has become vital in the 21st-century and people need to acquire such skills to enter the workforce e called 21st-century skills. In general, 21st-century skills include collaboration, communication, digital literacy, citizenship, problem solving, critical thinking, creativity and productivity (Voogt & Roblin, 2012). These skills are labelled 21st-century skills to indicate that they are more related to the
‘digital’, the digital aspect is often seen as a discrete skill e implying that the 21st-century skills are not necessarily under- pinned by ICT. Digital competence covers information manage- ment, collaboration, communication and sharing, creation of content and knowledge, ethics and responsibility, evaluation and problem solving and technical operations (Ferrari, 2012). Similar aspects are put forward in ‘21st-century skills’ deﬁnitions. The
is taken from the Partnership for 21st Cen- tury (P21). The P21 (2008) lists three types of skills: learning skills (creativity and innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, communication and collaboration), literacy skills (in- formation, media and ICT literacy) and life skills (ﬂexibility and adaptability, initiative and self-direction, social and cross- cultural skills, productivity and accountability, leadership and responsibility).

In particular, this paper utilises the work of Bernstein (1971, 1996) in considering the structuring of knowledge, curriculum and the sociocultural influences on and of curriculum. The work of Bernstein and others is then used to consider previous attempts to implement curriculum that have a focus on generic skills (for example the

has by some accounts (e.g. Fensham 2013) been a shift away from academics and teachers having the greatest amount of influence in the development of science curriculum toward a greater influence by educational bureaucrats. This, it is argued by Fensham, is due to a market view of education where practitioners’ expert contributions in curriculum development are taken only as advice rather
by government workers (Ball 1994). So while more conceptual reasons for introducing an interdisciplinary STEM curriculum are present, the current context is dominated by more instrumental justifications. This combination of influences on STEM curriculum has resulted in STEM being increas- ingly spoken about as a curriculum organizer where STEM is seen as an interdisciplinary curriculum that integrates aspects of science, technology,
as an ‘arena of struggle’ (1990, p. 206) where the different groups are each attempting to control the device. To this point, this paper has shown that the range of influences and groups invested in the current STEM curriculum in Australia has resulted in a curriculum that is attempting to provide ‘a solution or settlement to multiple coexisting agendas’ (Doherty, 2015)
field of knowledge production, there is a strong relationship between disciplines and their related school subjects and curriculum in the field of recontextualization. Different disciplines have different knowledge structures that influence how knowledge is reproduced in curriculum. These structures ‘impose constraints on appropriate curriculum form’ (Muller 2009, p. 216). Like the disciplines, school subjects have provided important social and epistemic groupings
over time. Integration of the disciplines and subject areas is therefore not straightforward but a complex and dynamic epistemic process that takes place over time and has a strong social influence (Klein 1990). There is not a single pattern for how disciplines or subjects interact and the level of integration in interdisciplinary work has been shown to change over time as
many aims of the current move toward STEM is to engage and retain a wider range of students, the kinds of interdisciplinary STEM curricula that are being implemented and the influence of these on students’ understanding needs further research and consideration.

elements can be incorporated into lit- eracy courses. According to Loerts and Belcher, visual journaling allows students to be ‘agentive in making meaning’ which strengthens their critical thinking, interpretation and collaboration skills. Whilst at the same time it challenges a deep-rooted belief that literacy is mainly about reading and writing. Experimenting with new modes of literacy has enabled teacher candidates in
the quality of their visual assignments and drawing skills (see, for example, Gadelshina, Cornwell & Spoors or Loerts & Belcher). Additionally, they have to provide for constructive feedback, sharing and collaboration possibilities that are greatly beneficial for visual literacy develop- ment either through the digital means or traditional dialogue (as pointed out by Abas; Heruti or Loerts & Belcher).

This type of working demands key competencies and attributes that readily align to ESD, for example creativity, innovation and adaptability. The demands of micro-businesses and start-ups, who rely on innovative developments, are increasingly related to sustainable enterprise and green credentials. As larger employers adapt, they too work towards sustainable innovation.
Equally, many start-ups are entirely focused on SD, creating powerful responses to social issues that need long-term solutions. Enabling ESD competencies and attributes such as creativity, opportunity recognition, self-determination and adaptability, taught through enterprise and entrepreneurship, can be a powerful catalyst for sustainable change.

Ways of thinking Systems thinking competency Systems thinking is a way of approaching problems that analyses how all the elements within a system influence one another. It is the ability to recognise and understand cause and effect in complex systems. Systems thinking requires the identification and classification of the parts of a system and
to derive meaning from information. It enables learners to critique the credibility and sources of knowledge, to recognise their own personal assumptions and values, and beyond this, what may have influenced them. It also develops the ability to analyse the thinking process itself, leading to critical reflection and a move beyond the description of an event or process, towards a deeper

Parents and families, a very influential group for college-bound students (Bregman & Killen, 1999), also hold gender schemas and through these, have a lifelong influence on shaping children’s choices of engineering and computing majors. Girls are more likely to be turned off by engineering than boys, given pervasive cultural beliefs about what kind of people
& Hill, 2015) includes a set of recommendations for attracting women into engineering and computer science. These are pre- sented below (with my own comments in italics). • Reduce the influence of unconscious biases in society at large. The authors recommend using role models to accomplish this in order to change the beliefs of both boys and girls about what kind
of people are engineers/ computer scientists. This approach may only change the biases in the girls’ and boys’ heads, and possibly only temporarily, since society at large is a powerful influence. It is difficult to “deprogram” a lifetime of belief. • Use affirmative action policies. This is ille- gal in some states, though one might argue that funding initiatives to broaden

Change in Higher Education Four key drivers in the higher education market can be described. Each driver has a radical change potential for higher education institutions and together they mutually influence each other and span the room in which higher education likely will develop. There are 2 content and curriculum related drivers (i.e. (1) personalized higher education and (2) future skill
higher education in the future will be most probably a certain pattern of configuration along the impact each of the four key drivers, called “pillars of change” has, and will influence the development of higher education strategies. 1 - An emerging focus on future skills radically changes the current definition of graduate attributes in higher education: The focus on a “next

and education to multiple areas of life is crucial for the success of the engineering professional, students said. Fundamental engineering and science classes should stress the importance of critical thinking, teamwork, and finding unique ways to solve problems. The engineering curriculum should also include coursework and opportunities to build other important professional KSAs such as communication, leadership, and system integration skills,
One student wondered whether emotional intelligence could be grasped through personality tests or a seminar with a psychologist. Some felt it could be encouraged outside class (“can’t teach it”) with teamwork, extracurricular activities, combined engineering school-company mixers, and other social events. Others thought it could be integrated with ethics. More could be done with instruction and practice in research and with
formula sheets while solving engineering problems in class. Students also found that open-ended exam questions prompt them to think critically about real-world problems. Problems offering more than one solution and teamwork were seen as helpful in developing personal and professional judgment as well as critical thinking. Assignments should require students to think before attempting to solve a problem. One example is

For example, social cognitive career theory claims that increasing students’ feelings of self-efficacy and providing them with relevant learning experiences can mediate background and proximal environmental influences on their career deci- sions and goal attainment (Lent et al., 2002).

It is important that we are attentive to the latter two elements in Lundy’s model—audi- ence and influence—as merely gathering student perspectives without enacting change (i.e., tokenizing student voice) will not combat systemic issues and may, in fact, be counterproduc- tive (Alderson, 2000).

The factor of self-organi- sation influences the respective dimensions of the educational concept and thereby, as a requirement, changes the content of the educational process. Self-organisation in this sense can not only be understood as a

According to Stein (2004) self-organisation is defined as system state caused solely by the system elements and the relations between them, without the influence of the environment.

Inner states influence themselves. The system behaviour can be derived neither from inputs nor from internal states. The complexity cannot be reduced. 4. Fourthly, the principle of redundancy applies. Information is distributed through-

development must be regarded as a reciprocal interactionist process between the individual and his social environment. The interactions are nested in each other and the various elements of the system influence each other. The modification of one element can result in the modification of another (Oerter 1995: 88), so that a network of interaction and relationship is formed. Thus, the ecological

Instead, these structures influence the individ- ual indirectly. On the other hand, the individual also impacts these structures obliquely. In summary, exo-systems can be described as sources of effects from distant environmental regions. This
an explanatory approach that shows how social systems and individuals interact at different levels, from the individual to the global social structure.

One development step leads to the other, the interactions are nested in each other and the different elements of the system influence each other. The different system levels are therefore interconnected. The ecosystem-theoretical approach is thus a further explanatory approach that shows how systems can relate to each other and communicate with
the global macro level and the local individual micro level. The use of Twitter to transmit political communication is one example of this: announcements often directly trigger a chain of influences that can be felt first politically, then economically, and then individually. The resulting connec- tion leads to a self-accelerating, self-acting and undirected, unpredictable, highly energetic further development in sub-areas of
energetic or informational isolation from the environment. 148 B 2 Foundations of the Future Skills Revolution This is because system disturbances that trigger structural changes can be caused by environmental influences. The system selects the extent and type of contact with the environment by defining the system boundary. This property is called structural coupling and means that there is an environmental
system. This is referred to as operative unity (ibid.). From the outside, only a view can be taken. Due to the operative unity and self-referentiality of autopoietic systems, a targeted influence on the system is impossible. Since the environment cannot recognise the state of the autopoietic system, the environment cannot judge how the system reacts to an environmental impact, a disturbance.

The influence in an organisational system or a team from the outside through information overflow, through digital media, can lead to changes in the system after autopoietic analysis, but these changes are

Administrators are also responsible for establishing a system for teacher collaboration on implementation of PBL (“Leading a Project-Based School,” 2009). In addition, because PBL might be a novel instructional approach for many teachers, administrators can provide teachers with the training they
have students to experience PBLs in the early stages of their education to help them develop the life- long essential skills such as self-directed learning, effective inquiry skills, and peer collaboration as early as possible. Project-based learning promotes self-directed learning environment, so students need to take control of their learning and develop self-learning skills. Research shows that students’ work habits, critical
PBL provides opportunities for students to improve these skills. Teachers have a role of promoting active student participation in group work by asking open-ended questions that encourage critical thinking and collaboration. These questions to any and all members will ensure teachers that group members shared the information related to the problem (Savery, 2006). Even though students work collaboratively with each other
rather at the boundaries of STEM fields. Therefore, STEM PBL, in which students engage in interdisciplinary inquiries that are often focused on real-world issues, is very relevant to the actual collaboration that takes place within the STEM fields.

Partnerships with local businesses, organizations or community agencies also provide additional opportunities for collaboration. It is important to keep in mind that there are advantages and disadvantages to every new approach and innovation, such as interdisciplinary STEM PBL. The process of planning and implementing
each group has to organize their own work, materials, individual duties, and manage their own time. Thus in STEM project-based learning, students take charge of their own learning and develop collaboration skills. At times, the less-structured nature of PBL, may make PBL classrooms appear to be unorganized, off-task, or out of control. The inquiry-based approach is primarily used in science education
to access multiple sources of information, apart from their teachers or textbooks, in order to solve complex real-life problems. It enables students to comprehend and use the information obtained through collaboration to learn one subject deeply, and to also learn multiple STEM subjects at the same time, adopting higher-order levels of thinking. It encourages, self-regulation, and the acquisition of life-long learning

Finally, it should be noted that the more integrated a social studies-STEM learning project is, the more planning, coordination, and collaboration is expected from the participating teachers. However, comprehensive integration can be associated with greater emphasis on cognitively engaging instruction (Applebee, Adler, & Flihan, 2007). Social studies and STEM educators should

Need/ motivation for achievement: individual's desire for significant accomplishment, mastering of skills, control, or high standards Digital literacy: ability to utilize digital technology in a creative way for learning, working, collaboration Communication competence: ability to actively create dialogue, achieve consensus and criticize Personal agility: positive attitude, resilience and openness to changes, being comfortable in ambiguous and changing situations Ability to reflect:
Personalization of academic learning The role of students was further investigated as the third factor. In the Delphi it was proposed that students would build their own personalized curriculum in collaboration with educational professionals, as one main theme. This would then result in a significant enlargement of choice, and – in addition – would move from a pre-defined ‘up-front’ given structure
Change in Higher Education Four key drivers in the higher education market can be described. Each driver has a radical change potential for higher education institutions and together they mutually influence each other and span the room in which higher education likely will develop.

are primarily built to identify hard skills. Unfortunately, using the same methodology for soft skills works poorly, because recruiters use diferent terms referring to the same skill (e.g., ‘teamwork’ and ‘collaboration’). For example, a soft skill can be cited as ‘writing reports,’ which implies that the candidate should have good written communication. Moreover, unlike hard skills, which are mainly expressed using
are mainly expressed using concept words, soft skills are varied in term of the parts of speech used: they may be nouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs or even phrases. For example, ‘collaboration’ may be expressed using an adjective such as ‘collaborative’ or the Vol.:(0123456789)1 3 43 Page 2 of 19 adverb ‘collaboratively’ or via the phrase ‘to collaborate with coworkers.’ In this
